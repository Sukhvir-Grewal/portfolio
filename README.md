# My first Portfolio

### The Plan: <br>

Well, folks, let me spill the beans about my grand plan. At first, I wanted things to be all classy and straightforward. You know, just a simple, elegant portfolio. But then, I got all wild and experimental. I started with Portfolio 1.0, then came Portfolio 2.0, and even a Portfolio 3.0, each with its own zany twist. Honestly, I had no clue where I was heading!

After a few days of this creative chaos, I had an epiphany. I decided to hit the reset button and set a clear goal. I thought, "Why not spice up this portfolio with some cool stuff to showcase my mad skills in both the front and back ends?" And then, out of the blue, the idea of a game hit me. I imagined a rocket launching from Earth to the Moon, sharing stories along the way. But hold on, that'd take ages to finish! So, I swiped a genius move from video games. You know that little character who guides you through the game? Yep, that's gonna be me, always hanging out at the bottom, chatting away with different versions of me while the story unfolds. And the rest of the design? Back to classy and simple, just like I originally dreamed. Ta-da! That's how I cooked up this masterpiece! ðŸš€ðŸ’«
